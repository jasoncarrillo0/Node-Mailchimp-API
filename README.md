# Node-Mailchimp-API
I built this app using Node, MongoDB, and basic web technologies (HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap). This app interacts with Mailchimp's API and allows for a user to sign up for an email list for an my Mailchimp account. I built this app part of an online bootcamp. Currently the app is deployed on Heroku at: http://agile-spire-69581.herokuapp.com/.
